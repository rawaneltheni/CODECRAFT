# 🧠 Internship Projects — Crypto & Security Mini-Repo

> Hey! This is a small collection of projects I built during my internship at CODECRAFT Infotech.  
> They focus on cryptography, image processing, and cybersecurity basics.  
> ⚠️ **All code here is for learning and educational use only — not for malicious purposes!**

## 📁 Projects Included

1. **Caesar Cipher**  
   Basic implementation of the classic substitution cipher — simple but great for understanding encryption fundamentals.

2. **Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption**  
   Explores pixel scrambling and permutation for basic image encryption concepts.

3. **Password Strength Checker**  
   Analyzes password strength and gives feedback to help users create stronger passwords.

4. **Simulated Keylogger (Educational Only)**  
   Demonstrates how keystroke capture works and how the keystroke captures be saved and sent via email or telegram bot to the attacker
   🧩 Used for understanding **defensive programming** and **cybersecurity awareness**.

## 🧭 Ethical Use Notice

- ❗ **Do not use any logging, capture, or encryption software on systems you don’t own or have explicit permission to test.**

- The keylogger project is **non-malicious and for education only**.

- Always:
  - Run in a VM or controlled environment.
  - Avoid using real passwords or sensitive data.
  - Get written permission if you’re testing in shared environments.
